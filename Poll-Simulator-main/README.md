# Poll-Simulator
The objective of this lab is to appreciate factoring for “multi-tier application architecture”. As a hands on small exercise, it lets you attempt implementing a web based “Poll Simulator”

Steps:

1. Clone this repository in your local system.
2. As node modules are not installed in it so firstly you have to open that folder where you cloned and then you have to write a command in terminal "npm install".
3. In order to run the project type "npm start" in the command prompt.

Note: You have to enter a candidate name in order to let people vote him/her.
While voting your vote will be counted but who voted whom will not be saved anywhere. But which candidate recieved how many number of votes would be saved and can be viewed in the voting summary.
